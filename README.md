This case study is about a digital bank called Data Bank.

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking
activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage
platform. Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits based on
how much money they have in their accounts. 

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer
base and need some help tracking just how much data storage their
customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the
business analyze their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their
future developments.
